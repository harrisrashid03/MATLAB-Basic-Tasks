## üìö Topics Covered

### üìò **Session 1: MATLAB Basics**
- MATLAB vs Octave
- Matrix creation and manipulation
- Trigonometric functions
- Variable management (`clc`, `clear all`)
- Built-in and custom functions
- Live scripts and `.m` files
- Solving linear equations
- Graph plotting (`hold on/off`)
- Simulation basics

### üìò **Session 2: Loops, Polynomials, and Visualization**
- `for` loops, `while` loops, `break` and `continue`
- Compound interest and bacterial growth modeling
- Polynomial operations (`polyval`, `roots`, `polyfit`)
- 2D & 3D plotting
- Working with real-life datasets
- RGB matrix manipulation and image visualization
